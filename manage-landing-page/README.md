### What I learned

This project seemed fairly simple at first, but I hit a couple of roadbumps along the way.  I first learned how to better emulate the documents that are given with the challenge.  this time I made sure to set my max-width of the page and I used this as the scale to compare with the images given.  I'm very happy with the way that my finished product came out as it is fairly equal in sizing and style to the original.

As I have completed most of my projects using no libraries and frameworks, this was a good exploration of using React for a SPA.  Though I don't think React was necessary at all for this, it was fun to try something different.  

With this project, I learned how to use component libraries and include them in my project.  This taught me how to read documentation, incorporate outside code, and use my own styling to integrate the component.  

### Continued development

I need to really study how to place blobs in the background.  I tried to use them as background-image and as an image, but I wasn't quite happy with either result.  

I would also like to implement more libraries into my code.  Using Swiper was fun...when it worked.  I had a hard time reading the documentation and figuring out how to style certain elements because the documentation was a bit convoluted and difficult to understand.
