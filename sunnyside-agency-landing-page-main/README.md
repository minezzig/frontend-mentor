## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great project to build a complete website. Though there wasn't a lot of Javascript, it was definitely a challenge for CSS alignment. This worked heavily with grid and aligning images within them. I learned more about how to label divs to make them clear and how you can then manipulate them. I struggled a little with the main image - specifically trying to get the image to fit, be responsive, and take up the correct amount of space. One of my favorite parts was the ::before pseudo code that I used on the navigation links within the page. They were very easy to create but gave great style to the page.

### Continued development

As always, I want to continue my work with alignment using grid, and specifically, how to work with images.
