## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## My process

### Built with

- HTML: data-attributes
- CSS: pseudo-classes, display: none
- Flexbox
- Javascript: event handlers


### What I learned

I'm really excited to be creating more interactive elements.  The idea that I can create an element that a user can input data and then move to a completley new page/image/div is really cool!  I learned how to do this by painting the dom with all of the necessary elements and then just hiding (using display: none) the element I don't yet want to see.  Then, using javascript, I can switch the display to hide the old and show another div.  I also really enjoyed using css pseudo-classes to create more visual interactivity by changing colors on hover and active.

### Continued development

I'm curious what is the best way to do some of these changes on click.  In this project I changed styles within the javascript code.  I wonder if it would be better to add classes instead and then write those classes in css...
