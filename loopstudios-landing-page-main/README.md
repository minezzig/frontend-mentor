## My process

I started to build the mobile version first.  I built out my HTML and then started up using Tailwind.  I built each element for mobile while also looking at the screenshots for desktop to see what structure may be best for my HTML.  As I wrote my Tailwind into the HTML and completed each section, I went back and added the responsive code to make the desktop version function as well.  I struggled a bit with the layout because I first went to flexbox and used the images as background.  I later started over and used grid as well as placed images within divs for each section.  This proved to be a much easier process.


### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties in tailwind
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first development


### What I learned

The main focus of this project was to work with Tailwind.  This was my first attempt at using it and I honestly found it to be a bit difficult.  I really enjoy using CSS and I love the flexibility it provides.  Using tailwind for the first time, I felt a bit constrained and boxed it.  I learned how to use tailwind documentation and how to funnel my ideas of classical css into the predetermined tailwind codes.  I see how easy it can be to create a very quick design using tailwind.

My favorite part is how easy it is to make a page responsive.  All the tailwind code can be written first for mobile, and then additional code is added right next to the same element!

I also learned how to use different images for mobile/desktop using the ```<picture>``` tag.


### Continued development

I would like to continue working with Tailwind and commit it to memory.  Although I have a love for CSS, tailwind has proven to be a quick way to add styling to a simple project.
