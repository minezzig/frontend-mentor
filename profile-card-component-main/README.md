## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project was my first experimentation with the website Frontend Mentor.  At the start I was very confused and not really confident in my skills.  The most important thing I learned in working on this project is that it is so important to plan ahead.  Before writing any code, I had to think about how I wanted to place my divs on the DOM and how I could manipulate them when needed.


### Continued development

I need to work on using semantic HTML and make sure that everything I need is placed in its own divs.
