### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first development
- Fully responsive


### What I learned

I'm really proud of this project!  I was able to finish it quickly with few challenges.  I'm really proud that I was able to use tailwind so seamlessly.  What I learned most about this project was that there is a definite formula when creating landing pages.  Yes, styles and presentation change, but there is a set format of what to include and how to include it.  I'm getting really good at viewing the sketches for mobile and desktop and planning out how exactly I want to strucutre my HTML before begining.  



### Continued development

There are a couple of CSS effects that I wanted to include, but felt a bit stumped when trying to implement them in tailwind.  For example, I wanted an underline to appear under links when hovered that would grow from the center.  I know how to create this in CSS, but in tailwind it seemed more difficult.  I would like to continue to work on this project and implement this in tailwind.
